Structural:
  HMC using reversediff.
    How?
    Construct dict of values for continuous variables --- hashtable going from RV object id to call.
  Particle Gibbs annealing.

Convergence diagnostics:
  trace plot
  autocorrelation
  histogram
  implementation
    @samples(1000, :a, :b, :c)

Optimization:
  Collapse deterministic functions?
  Use deterministic functions from numeric_extensions for speed?  (No function lookup).

Extend libraries:
  Vectors:
    IID(dist, dims)
    Joint(dist1, dist2...)
    Joint(dists)
  When lifting functions, allow Array{Sample} to be passed into deterministic function
